2. Enter the username and password for the account that will run the task
   - This should be an account with administrator privileges
   - The account must have permission to access the installation directory and execute the application

## Testing the Task

After creating the scheduled task, you should test it to ensure it runs correctly:

1. In Task Scheduler, locate your task in the Task Scheduler Library
2. Right-click on the task and select **Run**
3. Check the following to verify it ran correctly:
   - Task history in Task Scheduler (right-click task â†’ View History)
   - Log files in the `logs` directory
   - Output CSV files in the configured output directory

## Troubleshooting

### Task Shows "Last Run Result: 0x1" or Other Error Codes

- **Cause**: The batch file or application encountered an error
- **Solution**: Check the log files in the `logs` directory for details about the error

### Task Doesn't Run at Scheduled Time

- **Cause**: Computer might be powered off or Task Scheduler service not running
- **Solution**: Ensure the computer is powered on and the Task Scheduler service is set to Automatic startup

### Application Runs But No Data Is Collected

- **Cause**: Could be network connection issues or changes to the FMCSA website
- **Solution**: Check the application logs and verify internet connectivity

### "Access Denied" Errors

- **Cause**: The account running the task doesn't have sufficient permissions
- **Solution**: 
  1. Right-click on the task and select Properties
  2. Go to the General tab
  3. Click "Change User or Group" and enter an administrator account
  4. Enter the password when prompted

## Modifying the Schedule

The FMCSA Scraper is designed to use the schedule defined in the `config.ini` file, in the `[Schedule]` section. If you want to change when the application runs:

1. Open `config.ini` in a text editor
2. Navigate to the `[Schedule]` section
3. Modify the following settings:
   - `Enabled` - Set to `true` or `false`
   - `RunTimesUTC` - List of times in UTC format (e.g., `03:00,15:00`)
   - `RunDaysOfWeek` - List of days (1=Monday to 7=Sunday, e.g., `1,2,3,4,5`)
   - `RunOnStart` - Set to `true` to run immediately when launched

Remember that the Task Scheduler configuration serves primarily to launch the application, and the detailed run schedule is controlled by the application's configuration file.
